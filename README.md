Pomodoro Timer

The original idea: https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique

I wanted to create this project because I found that if I kept a timer running while I was learning to code, I was more efficient and focused on my work. I also ran into the issue of looking at my phone too often.

To solve this issue, I decided to make a timer for myself using Javascript. The current version allows for a short 25 minute timer, and a longer 50 minute timer. Each timer is accompanied by  a specific rest timer.

In the future, I would like to add the ability for a user to add their own customer work/break pomodoro timer.
